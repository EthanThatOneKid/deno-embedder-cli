# deno-embedder-cli

A CLI tool for the https://deno.land/x/embedder/mod.ts module.

This tool generates a file that embeds the desired files into a single file. The
generated file can be used as a module in Deno.

### Developer's note

All awesome things about this module are attributed to the original author,
[**@NfNitLoop**](https://github.com/NfNitLoop). Blame me for anything that I
potentially got wrong.
